## Essentials of Network Security

Acompletely secure and robust network can
be designed with proper implementation and
configuration of network security elements
 

## Elements of Network Security
- Network Security Controls
 - Network Security Protocols
 - Network Security Devices

## Goal of Network Defense

-  ` The ultimate goal of network defense is to protect an
  organization's information,systems,and network infrastructure
  from unauthorized access,misuse,modification,service denial,
  or any degradation and disruptions `
  
 -  ` Organizations rely on information assurance(IA)principles to
  attain defense-in-depth security `
  
  - `Information Assurance(IA)principles act as enablers for an
  organization's security activities to protect and defend the
  organizational network from security attacks `
  
 ## Information Assurance(IA)Principles

## Information Assurance(IA)Principles(Cont'd)

## Non-repudiation
Ensures thataparty inacommunication
cannot deny sending the message

 ## Network Defense Benefits
- Protect information assets
- Comply with government and industry specific
regulations
- Ensure secure communication with clients and suppliers
- Reduce the risk of being attacked
- Gain competitive edge over competitor
by providing more secure services
  
## Network Defense Challenges

### Distributed Computing

 - Environments
 With the advancement in
 modern technology and to
 meet business requirements,
 networks are becoming vast
 and complex,potentially
 leading to serious security
 vulnerabilities.Attackers
 exploit exposed security
 vulnerabilities to
 compromise network
 security

### Emerging Threats

- Potential threats to the
network evolve each day.
Network security attacks
are becoming technically
more sophisticated and
better organized

### Lack of Network

- Security Skills
Organizations are failing
to defend themselves
against rapidly increasing
network attacks due to
the lack of network
security skills

 ## Network Security Controls:
 ##    Administrative Security Controls
          
   The management implements administrative access controls to ensure the safety of the organization
       Examples of Administrative Security Controls
 - Regulatory framework Compliance
- Employee Monitoring and Supervising
 - Security policy
  - Information Classification
   - Security Awareness and Training
